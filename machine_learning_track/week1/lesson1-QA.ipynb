    "- Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept\n",
    "- Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles\n",
    "- Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy\n",
    "- Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions\n",

    "- Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games\n",
    "- Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up\n",

    "**5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?**\n",
    "1. They showed that a single layer of these devices was unable to learn some simple but critical mathematical functions (such as XOR). In the same book, they also showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow these limitations to be addressed. Unfortunately, only the first of these insights was widely recognized. --> Didnt use more than one layer\n",
    "2. In theory, adding just one extra layer of neurons was enough to allow any mathematical function to be approximated with these neural networks, but in practice such networks were often too big and too slow to be useful. --> Should have used more that two layers. Also coupled with improvements in computer hardware later made it possible\n",

    "- graphics processing unit, or GPU, is designed for parallel processing. \n",
    "- It is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering, it is becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).\n",
    "- raphics Processing Unit (GPU): Also known as a graphics card. A special kind of processor in your computer that can handle thousands of single tasks at the same time, especially designed for displaying 3D environments on a computer for playing games. These same basic tasks are very similar to what neural networks do, such that GPUs can run neural networks hundreds of times faster than regular CPUs. All modern computers contain a GPU, but few contain the right kind of GPU necessary for deep learning.\n",
